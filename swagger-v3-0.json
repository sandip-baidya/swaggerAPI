FranConnect&rsquo;s APIs are RESTful in nature and support the transfer Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"western\">Rate limits and accounts</h3>\n<p>Currently, FranConnect&rsquo;s REST APIs do not impose any rate limit restrictions but users are expected to retrieve data after certain interval and retrieve only the deltas (wherever applicable) so as to not overload the system. Retrieving a large dataset might result in slowness and impede the overall system performance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"western\">Concurrent Requests</h3>\n<p>Franconnect&rsquo;s APIs do not support concurrent requests and the API expects that the requests be served one at a time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"western\">Authentication</h3>\n<p>FranConnect supports OAuth 2.0 for authenticating requests before they can be used to perform CRUD operations using FranConnect&rsquo;s API. Further details on how to set up the authentication and generate the access token can be found <span style=\"color: #0563c1;\"><u><a href=\"#tag/Authentication\">here</a></u></span>.</p>"
